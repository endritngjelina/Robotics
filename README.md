# Mobile Robotics Projects â€“ CDA 4621

This repository includes my robotics control programs developed during the **CDA 4621 â€“ Control of Mobile Robotics** course.

I used **Webots**, a robot simulation platform, to model mobile robots and test different control strategies in a virtual environment. The projects cover both basic and more advanced behaviors used in real-world robotics.

### ðŸ¤– Topics Covered

- Mobile robot kinematics
- Differential drive control
- Sensor-based navigation
- Obstacle avoidance
- Path following
- Basic PID control

### ðŸ§° Tools Used

- **Webots** for simulation and environment setup
- Programming in **C/C++** or **Python** (depending on the assignment)
- Realistic robot models and sensor data

### ðŸš€ Purpose

These projects helped me learn how to design and implement control systems for autonomous mobile robots, test behaviors in simulation, and understand how real-time decisions can be modeled virtually.
